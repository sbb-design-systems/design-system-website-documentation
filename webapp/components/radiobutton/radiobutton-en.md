* It is used to select precisely one of several options.


## 2. Wann soll das Element eingesetzt werden?

## 3. Rules
* A radio button is only permitted within a form.
* There must be a choice of at least two options.
* A pre-selection is mandatory.
* Radio buttons can be arranged vertically or horizontally. The vertical layout is preferred as it allows the user to understand the options more quickly.
* The text can be multi-line.
* In addition to the actual radio button, the entire text can also be used as a click target.
* A title can be used above a radio button group.
* A question mark in the circle can also be shown – in addition to the title – for detailed explanations on a radio button group. A [tooltip](https://digital.sbb.ch/en/webapps/components/tooltip) opens if this question mark is clicked on.
