## 1. What does the component do?
* It is used to structure the display of data and forms.


## 2. When should the component be used? 
* For switching between various aspects within the same context.
* When the content of various aspects cannot be seen at the same time by the user.


## 3. Rules
* There are at least two tabs.
* The first tab is always selected by default.
* The tab names are always single-line.
* The tab name should be as simple and concise as possible so that the themes can be quickly understood.
* All tabs should be the same width, even when a name is not as long as others.
* If the tab is too long for the viewport, the width is shortened and the names are shortened with “…”. When hovering over the tab, the complete name appears in a [tooltip](https://digital.sbb.ch/en/webapps/components/tooltip).
* Another tab module is not permitted within a tab (tab-in-tab).
