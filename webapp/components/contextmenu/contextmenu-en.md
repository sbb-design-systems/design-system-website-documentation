## 1. What does the component do?
* It provides context-specific actions, either dynamically via right mouse click on an element or statically via an icon.


## 2. When should the component be used?
* â€¢	When actions for efficient execution are to be provided on an object depending on the status or role of the user.


## 3. Rules
* A context menu can be provided via the right mouse click or via an icon.
* The context menu may contain icons but does not have to.
* On a level of the context menu, there is either an icon for all menu items or none at all.
* Menu items can be grouped. Groups are separated by a dash.
* A context menu can be used for sorting elements. In this case, an arrow is used to show which attribute is used for sorting and in which direction.
* Providing deeper level structures is also permitted. However, it is worth noting that the more complex, the less efficient it is to use.
