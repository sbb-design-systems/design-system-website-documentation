## What is a design system?
A design system consists of a collection of guidelines, rules, principles for design (behavior and visual language) and code.
This ensures a coherent and consistent order of the user interface within applications, landing pages and complete systems.


## Goals
### Unification of user interfaces
* Keeps the learning curve flat for user interfaces
* Gives the user security and confidence when operating known patterns.
* Common understanding of the SBB design language

### Speed and cost savings 
* More efficient prototyping through documentation and Sketch Library
* Reduction of redundancies in development
* Simpler quality assurance through approved elements, modules, page types

All elements, modules and components are available in a sketch library.
To install the library, follow the link. This allows you to quickly and easily benefit from improvements and enhancements. The library usually requires the latest Sketch version.
