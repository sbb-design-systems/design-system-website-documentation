## 1. Use
Icons are used to visually support themes and actions. Icons are used in SBB style for use in SBB applications. Details on this and a set of already available icons can be found [here](https://digital.sbb.ch/en/logo-icons-und-piktogramme/icons).


## 2. Rules
* The use of icons within body copy should be avoided as far as possible.
* Icons without text must be self-explanatory or easy to learn. The more icons used in an application, the more difficult it becomes to understand their meaning.
* Icons should always have the same meaning (consistency) across all applications.


## 3. Accessibility
* Icons without text must include an alternative text.
* The icon itself does not have to be described but instead its function in text form (e.g. ‘close menu’).
