## 1. What does the component do?
It is used for the entry of large amounts of text in forms.

## 2. When should the component be used?
When the entry of longer text is required from the user.

## 3. Rules
* The text area always has a label.
* Optional entries include the text ‘(optional)’ behind the label text. The text ‘(optional)’ can be shortened to ‘(opt.)’ for short fields.
* A question mark in the circle – in addition to the label – can be used for detailed explanations. A [tooltip](https://digital.sbb.ch/en/components/tooltip) opens when this question mark is clicked on.
* The number of characters still available is shown bottom right (outside the text area is disabled).
* The width of the text area is always the same as the entire width of the form.
* The basic height can be set when designing the form.
* If the text is longer than the basic height of the text area, the element increases in height with the content.
