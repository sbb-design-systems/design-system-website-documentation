## 1. What does the module do?
It is used to promote topics and content.

## 2. When should the module be used? 
For navigating from a thematic overview page to the detailed pages.

## 3. Rules 
* Teaser always consists of an [image](https://digital.sbb.ch/en/basics/images) (no videos), a headline, copy where applicable and a [link](https://digital.sbb.ch/en/components/link).
* Teasers can link internal or external pages.
* When hovering, the image increases to 110% (masked) and the link changes to the hover version.

## 4. Variants and statuses
The module has the following statuses:
* Normal
* Hover

### 4.1 Tiles
* All tiles together have a heading.
* The link text is always called ‘more info’.
* The headline is a maximum of two lines.
* The headline/copy spacing is fixed.
* The background is based on the height of the longest teaser (within the group).
* The definition of the ‘more info’ link position is fixed from the bottom edge of the background area. This means the spacing between the copy and the link is flexible.
* The copy is a maximum of four lines.
* The copy is hidden in the mobile layout.
* If the copy text is too long, the sentence is ended with ‘…’. Words are not cut.
* The entire area (image and text) is clickable.
* Three to six teasers can be inserted. The width of the teaser is modified if the number of teasers is uneven (3 and 5).
* The 5th and 6th teaser always appear centred on a second line.
* Keyboard operation: The individual teasers can be jumped to via tabs.

### 4.2 Content-wide teaser
This variant has the following statuses:
* Automode active
* Automode inactive

* One to three images can be used in the teaser.
* The images are automatically alternated by default (every five seconds).
* The automatic animation moves the images from right to left. This also applies when changing from the last to the first image. With a manual change to a previous image, it then moves from left to right.
* The teaser contains the red SBB panel (with title and a link, e.g. ???)
    * Icons can also be shown in the panel as an option. They are not shown in the mobile view.
    * An action element can also be used with the panel as an option. This can only contain text.

* This teaser is usually used at the start of the page.
* The automatic animation is interrupted when hovering.
* Swipe interaction can be used to move between images on mobile devices.
* The automatic animation is interrupted when moving to a different image manually.
* Keyboard operation:
    * The individual elements of the navigation bar beneath the images (play/pause button, bullets for the individual images) can be skipped using tabs.
    * The elements can be selected using Space or Enter.
    * After the last bullet, the image in the carousel is jumped to using the tab. The content of this teaser can be skipped using Enter.
