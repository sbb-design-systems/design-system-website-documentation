## 1. What does the module do?
*   It dims the current view and puts a modal dialogue over it.

## 2. When should the module be used?
*   When the user’s attention is required.
*   When information/input is required from the user.
*   When related content is to be displayed.
*   When additional content is to be displayed.
*   The module is not suitable for error messages, warnings or similar notifications.

## 3. Rules
*   The user must always have the option of closing the modal dialogue.
*   Any modal dialogue consists of a header (close icon and title) and content.
*   The content must contain at least an interaction element (e.g. ‘save’ or ‘OK’).
*   The modal dialogue cannot be used for error messages.
*   The width and height of the dialogue is determined by the size of the content.
*   A minimum space from the screen edge must be kept.
*   The modal dialogue is closed if the dimmed section is clicked on.
*   If the content is too big, a full-screen modal dialogue can be selected: see page types.
