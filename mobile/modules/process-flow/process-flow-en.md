## 1. What does the module do? 
*   It divides a process/form into several sub-steps and shows the user which step they are on.

## 2. When should the module be used? 
*   For long forms which can be grouped thematically. 
*   For multi-stage processes with a decision-making tree.

## 3. Rules 
*   The steps are numbered. 
*   The active step is written out (number and title). 
*   The title must be single-line. 
*   Is suitable for around two to five steps. 
*   The process flow is always at the top, positioned directly after the header. 
*   The user can navigate back to a previous process step in the process flow. 
*   Forward navigation in the process flow is only permitted through the call-to-action of the page concerned. Skipping (forward) of steps is not permitted.
