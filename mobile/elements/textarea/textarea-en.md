## 1. What does the element do?
*   It is used for entering larger amounts of text in forms.

## 2. When should the element be used?

## 3. Rules
*   The text area always has a label.
*   Optional entries include the text ‘(optional)’ behind the label text. The text ‘(optional)’ can be abbreviated to ‘(opt.)’ for shorter fields.
*   An infoicon can be displayed in the entry field for detailed explanations. A tooltip opens if this infoicon is clicked on.
*   The width of the text area is always the same as the entire width of the form.
*   The basic height can be set when designing the form.
*   If the text is longer than the basic height of the text area, the text already entered shifts upwards. The text area maintains its original size.
