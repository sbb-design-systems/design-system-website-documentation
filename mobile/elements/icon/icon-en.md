## 1. What does the element do?
*   It defines all permitted icons and the icon style in the SBB context.

## 2. When should the element be used?
*   For the design of all applications in the SBB context.
*   Icons are used on buttons, for links, in tag-clouds and in navigation.
*   Icons are used for the visual representation of topics and the visual support of actions.

## 3. Rules
*   The use of icons within texts should be avoided as far as possible.
*   Icons without text must be self-explanatory or easy to learn. The more icons used in an application, the more difficult it becomes to understand their meaning.
*   Icons should always have the same meaning (consistency) across all applications.
