## 1. What does the component do?
* It is used to show the user which stage of a process they are on.

## 2. When should the component be used?
* In all processes where a user has to go through several steps/pages to complete them.

## 3. Rules
* The process flow is always positioned at the top immediately after the [breadcrumb](https://digital.sbb.ch/en/components/breadcrumb).
* The user can navigate back to a process step already passed through.
* Forward navigation in the process is only permitted by the call-to-action of the page concerned. Skipping steps (forward) is not permitted.
